<h2>TRANSFORM DATA INTO INSIGHTS</h2> <!--Degree Description-->
   <p class="text">Businesses depend on software and data systems to inform their processes and to provide a competitive edge. Data-forward software developers capture streams of information and make this information useful to people and companies. University of Advancing Technology's Data Science degree provides students the skills that are needed as more aspects of our world and environments are connected and generate real-time information in ways that can be captured and used. Human behavioral patterns, IoT, weather, nature, connected city infrastructures, biological, health and organizational operations are typical of systems generating data now and into the future. </p>

    <p class="text">Students in UAT's Data Science program will learn to craft code that interacts with data and present it in a way that creates understanding and value to organizations, communities and individuals. They will work with large data sets that often are being created in real-time. </p>

    <p class="text">Graduates will be capable of working with dynamic data, understanding how to identify and focus on key elements of data, be able to draw conclusions from it and present discovered information to others in ways that are easily used and able to draw conclusions from.</p>
